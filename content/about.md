A software engineer with 5+ years of professional experience in developing applications including Windows phone, Windows and Xamarin forms, I have successfully published many applications to the market, either inside a team or indie. 
I follow best practices to keep the quality of code at high bar including architecture patterns like MVVM plus design patterns.
